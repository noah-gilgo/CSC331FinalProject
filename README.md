# A GUI demonstrating a simple numbers game. Requests the user for a string input (user name) and an integer ('difficulty'). 
# The game requires the user to insert an array of integers (e.g. 1,2,3,4 (commas included)) between 0 and 9 of a length equal to the integer input for 'difficulty'.

# In order to win the game, the user must input a number array identical to the hidden number array generated at the beginning of every round. 
# When the user inputs the array, two numbers are returned: the number of correct numbers guessed, and the number of correct numbers in the correct position within the array 
# corresponding to the hidden array.

# Several stat checkboxes are present at the bottom of the GUI, allowing the user to see the stats corresponding to each box name when they click the 'Display Stats' button. 
# The stats from each game are saved within a .txt file when the window for the GUI is closed.

# Pressing 'Clear Display' clears the text area.
